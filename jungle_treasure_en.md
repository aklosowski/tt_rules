# Jungle treasure

You and your friends drive deep into the jungle to recover some old treasure. The deeper in the jungle you go the richer it gets. But the more you carry the more fuel you use from your common supply. And if you run out of fuel before you get back then the treasure stays in the jungle.

## Setup

Each player gets a car in a different colour.

There are two special dice. Each die has two of each face values: 1, 2 and 3.

The treasures form a path, increasing in value.

- 8 randomly shuffled treasures of Tier I: two of each 0, 1, 2, 3
- 8 randomly shuffled treasures of Tier II: two of each 4, 5, 6, 7
- 8 randomly shuffled treasures of Tier III: two of each 8, 9, 10, 11
- 8 randomly shuffled treasures of Tier IV: two of each 12, 13, 14, 15

The first player to play and the order are selected randomly.

## Object of the Game

Players drive into the jungle 3 times, each time starting with a full 25L fuel tank.

Each drive ends when everyone comes back to the edge of the jungle or if the common fuel runs out.

To gain points, you need to bring treasure from the jungle. The player with the highest amount of money earned from their treasure wins.

## Play

Players, going clockwise, take turns. Players who have already returned from the jungle are skipped. In a player's turn the following things happen:

### Fuel is consumed

Fuel is taken from the common supply: 1L per treasure carried by the player. Treasure retrieved in previous rounds doesn't count. If there isn't enough fuel for the player to make a move, the round ends.

### Direction of travel is declared

At the beginning of their turn the player can decide to start travelling out of the jungle by pressing the UP arrow button, but only before rolling the dice. Once they're travelling back they cannot change the direction again.

### Player travels

The player rolls both dice. The player travels by a number of fields equal to their roll.

If they're carrying treasure the number of treasures is substracted from the score.

> The player might not be able to move

Fields where another driver is parked are jumped over and not counted in the travel.

### Player takes or leaves the treasure

If the player parks on a field with a treasure they decide whether to take it or leave it in place. If they decide to take it, they carry it with them without revealing its value until the round is over and they have returned to the edge of the jungle. The field where they're parked is replaced with a blank.

> There is no limit on number of treasures a player can carry but remember each treasure carried affects the amount of fuel needed per move and the distance the player can travel

If the player already carrying treasure parks on a blank field, they can replace one of the treasures they carry in order to use less fuel and travel greater distances.

## End of round

At the end of a drive, the following things happen:

- Players who came out of the jungle have their treasure's value added to their pot.

- Players who didn't make it back lose the treasure they are carrying, it lands in the deptht of the jungle in stacks of 3. From now on these stacks are counted as single treasures. Players come back to the edge of the jungle.

- Blank fields are removed and the gaps are closed.

- The last player to return takes the first turn of the next dive.

## End of game

At the end of the third drive and adding players' treasure values to their pots a winner is revealed â€“ the player with the most money earned.
