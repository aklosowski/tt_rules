# Liar's dice

Liar's dice is a game for two or more players requiring the ability to deceive and to detect an opponent's deception. As the game progresses players will have less and less dice. The goal of the game is the be the last person standing (with at least 1 or more dice).

## Setup

Each player receives 5 dice.

The first player to play and the order are selected randomly.

## New round

When a new round starts all players roll all their dice in secret from others. Each player can only see the result of their own roll.

Players then take turns.

## Turns

On their turn, a player can perform one of the following actions:

### Bidding

The player makes a bid representing a number (count) of dice of a given face value that have supposedly been rolled by all players collectively.

For example a bid of "5 threes" translates to "I'm claiming that at least 5 threes were rolled among us".

Unless it is the first bid of a round, the bid has to be higher than the previous bid in one of the following ways:

1. The count is higher (e.g. "4 sixes" can be followed by "5 ones")

1. The count is the same but the face value is higher (e.g. "4 fives" can be followed by "4 sixes" but not by "4 fours")

After a bid, the next player (clockwise) takes their turn.

> In the first turn of a round the player must make a bid.

### Calling a bluff

Calling a bluff after the previous player made a bid of "5 threes" translates to "I believe that less than 5 threes were rolled among us".

Calling a bluff ends a round and all players reveal dice from their hands where the face value is equal to that of the current bid.

If the player calling a bluff is correct then the player who made the current bid loses 1 die.

If the player calling a bluff is wrong then they lose 1 die.

Players who lost all 5 dice are out of the game.

A new round starts. If the player calling a bluff still has dice, they make the first bid of the new round. Otherwise, the next player (clockwise) who is still in the game makes the first bid.

### Claiming exact

Claiming exact after the previous player made a bid of "5 threes" translates to "I believe that exactly 5 threes were rolled among us".

Claiming exact ends a round and all players reveal dice from their hands where the face value is equal to that of the current bid.

If the player claiming exact is correct then all other players lose 1 die each.

If the player claiming exact is wrong then they lose 1 die.

Players who lost all 5 dice are out of the game.

A new round starts. If the player claiming exact still has dice, they make the first bid of the new round. Otherwise, the next player (clockwise) who is still in the game makes the first bid.

## The end

The game ends when all but one player have lost all 5 dice. The player who still has at least one die wins.
